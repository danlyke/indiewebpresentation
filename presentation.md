## A Brief History of Weblogs

Not quite escribitionism

- August 1997: Scripting News and Steve Jobs' return to Apple
- Jorn Barger coined "weblog" in December 1997
- my own Newwwsboy, February 1998.
- "Microportals"
- Peter Merholz coined "blog" in April or May of 1999

  I've decided to pronounce the word "weblog" as wee'- blog. Or "blog" for short."

- Dave Winer building a community
- Pyra launches Blogger, August 23 1999

## Social Media: evil

- Data apocalypse (from your ISP to GeoCities to TwitPic)
- Controlling presentation
- NymWars
- Content restrictions
- Searching your history

---

## How do we fix this?

- Back to blogs?
- POSSE: Publish Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere
- PESOS: Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate Own Site
- Interop between personal sites
- Search / Syndication
- Is the web the right platform?

---

## Back to blogs

- *.blogspot.com/*.wordpress.com just lets someone else own it.
- domain names are hard to justify, and expire
- but at least you own it.
